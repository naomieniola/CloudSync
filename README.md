CloudSync ðŸŽ¶

CloudSync is a simplified music streaming web application built using ASP.NET Core MVC. The application allows users to browse songs, view artist information, and play audio files directly from the web browser. The project demonstrates the use of the ASP.NET Core framework, leveraging its features for handling user interactions, managing data, and displaying a dynamic front-end.

Project Overview ðŸ“œ
CloudSync was built as a final project during my Software Development and Engineering training at Robert Walters. The aim was to apply the ASP.NET Core MVC framework to build a structured web application using the Model-View-Controller design pattern. The application uses a SQL Server database to store and manage information about songs, artists, and genres.

Features âœ¨
User Authentication and Authorization: Secure user registration and login.
Dynamic Song Listing: Songs are displayed dynamically based on database entries.
Artist Information Display: Show details about artists and their associated songs.
Audio Playback: Use the HTML5 <audio> element to play songs directly from the app.
Structured MVC Architecture: Clean separation of concerns using Models, Views, and Controllers.
